# RiderGate - Streamlit Ride Booking App

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, traditional methods of booking rides and tickets for public transportation can be cumbersome and time-consuming. The need for a seamless, efficient, and contactless ticketing solution has never been more critical to enhance the user experience and streamline the boarding process.

## Solution Overview

RiderGate offers a digital solution to the conventional ticketing system by allowing users to book their rides through a simple and intuitive interface. The app generates a QR code upon booking, containing all the necessary ride details, which can then be scanned by the bus driver, eliminating the need for physical tickets and reducing boarding time.

## Technologies/Software/Programming Language Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to develop the backend logic, including QR code generation and handling form submissions.
- **QR Code Library**: Used to generate QR codes containing ride details.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing tasks, though its usage was minimized in the final implementation.
- **Requests**: Initially considered for integrating Google Maps API for distance and duration calculations, but was ultimately not used in the final solution.

## How to Run the Program

To run RiderGate, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively. To setup your own venv, type the following:
Python -m venv .venv


2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install streamlit qrcode pillow requests io
     ```
   
3. **Launch the App**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the app's script (`main.py` or a similar filename).
   - Run the app using Streamlit by executing:
     ```
     streamlit run ./main.py
     ```
   - Streamlit will start the web server, and you can access the app through the web browser at the indicated URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
